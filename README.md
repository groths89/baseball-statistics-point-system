# ‚öæ Baseball Statistics Point System: New York Mets Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a custom analytical tool designed to score the quality of play for the New York Mets plabeyond standard Wins and Losses. It utilizes the MLB Stats API, and the Python package `MLB-StatsAPI` to process Box Score and Play-by-Play data, applying a complex, situational point system to measure team momentum, clutch performance, and defensive excellence. The final goal is to create a Full-Stack application that visualizes these custom scores and potentially correlates them with advanced metrics like WAR.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack (MVP)

| Area             | Technology                | Purpose    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Data Acquisition | Python (statsapi) Library | Fetch game schedules, box scores, and play-by-play data.|
| Backend/Logic    | Python        | Core scoring engine and data parsing logic. |
| Data Persistence |  |  |
| API              |  |  |
| Frontend/Visual  |  |  |

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project gets a schedule for the given team, in one instance it is the New York Mets. It processes the data and calculates points adding and subtracting a certain number of points for each event a player and team does. If a player does well in the game they can bring value to a team's success.

1. Fetch Schedule: Use `statsapi.schedule(team=121)` to get all completed game IDs.

2. Fetch Data: For each game ID, retrieve two data sets: `statsapi.boxscore_data()` and `statsapi.last_game(teamId)` (for totals) and `statsapi.get('game_play_by_play')` (for situational details).

3. Calculate Scores: Apply the scoring logic defined below.

4. Persist: Store the game ID and the final point breakdown into the database.

### Usages
- From the function `statsapi.last_game(teamID)` then use this in the function right below

- From the function `statsapi.boxscore(gamenumber)`

- `homePitchers`

- `homeBattingNotes`

- `homePitchingTotals`

- `homeBattingTotals`

- `teamStats`

- `{'title': 'FIELDING', 'fieldList': [{'label': 'DP', 'value': '2 (Baty-McNeil-Alonso; Lindor-McNeil-Alonso).'}]}], 'note': []}`

## üíØ Custom Point System
